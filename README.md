# Amelia Earheart Biography

The Amelia Earheart Biography page is a small website about Amelia Earheart's life and accomplishments. The site is targeted toward people who might be interested to learn and know more about this elusive woman who is also so prominent as one of the first prominent female pilots. The site is intended to inform and to point interested people in the right direction for more information. It is also intended to promote to some extent a spirit of adventure in the same line as some of Earheart's adventures as a pilot and young woman. This biography and flight enthusiast page will also encourage its readers to fly and meet other people with similar interests.

## Features 

This website features an About section, with interesting facts and important details about Earheart's life, along with a segment about Earheart's appeal to society and her positive reception. This should appeal to history enthusiasts, people with a spirit for adventure and people who would like to push their boundaries, acheive things and go to places where society doesn't expect them to. Earheart is valuable rolemodel generally, but may also hold appeal for women and girls who question gender stereotypes and who would resist being pidgeonholed by their circumstances.

There is also a Gallery section with pictures of Earheart and some of her planes, giving the reader a more detailed picture of Earheart and her adventures and life.

Finally, there is a Contact section where readers may get in touch with the website's creator to find out more details about where to meet other flight/Earheart enthusiasts, doing flight lessons and following some of the flight-paths that Amelia herself undertook. This will encourage more engagement and interaction, and will increase Earheart's recognition as a prominent figure in both history and in women's history. There is a resources section also to point readers in the right direction to learn more about the machinery involved in flight, repairing equipment and more about Earheart's life. This website is a good way for people to continue practicing the same values such as human progress and exploration that were so prominent in the early 1900s and in Earheart's life. It will inform people and perhaps introduce them to the joy of flying and freedom of movement and choice!

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

Some elements of sample projects I worked on helped to inform and inspire some choices that I made while making this website. Theses include Code Institiute's Coder's Coffeehouse, the Love Running and the Love Maths projects. I also practiced with a website about an Apiary, and a site for generating names for sheep.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
